title: End of my frontend & telegram career
description:
  After getting tired from blogging and website designing, I decided to end my
  frontend career & blogging on telegram channel.
slug: end-of-frontend-telegram
date: May 26, 2023

Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking about my career, personality and the things I‚Äôm doing
right now. Every time when I posted something on my Telegram channel, I found
myself dissatisfied. Even though, my friends were telling me that I wasn‚Äôt doing
right. At the beginning, I didn‚Äôt take that seriously, because I believed that I
have to follow the ethics of my personality that were crafted by myself.
However, all this time, I‚Äôve been drowning in the deepest, darkest sides of my
heart which led me to depression and endless sadness which affected my life as a
whole.

You might have noticed that I posted lots of hate and nonsensical things about
me which had nothing to do with people. I forgot something, something that
helped me to become who I am right now‚Ä¶

Maybe it‚Äôs just me? Maybe it‚Äôs just my past feelings that are slowly convincing
me to remember my horrible past I went through. Maybe it‚Äôs just the emptiness of
my heart and feelings of being lonely‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, I just can‚Äôt assume it all.

The last few days, I stood silent and started thinking about myself. **Who am I?
Why am I doing this? Why should I have to?** Do you remember me changing the
wallpaper to a black background with a little red dot? That was actually the
colors left in me‚Ä¶ and now‚Ä¶ even that red dot has gone! Now I‚Äôm left with
nothing but a black emptiness in my mind which leads me to the drench of mixed
feelings. Maybe I was angry then, because I was helpless and couldn‚Äôt control my
emotions‚Ä¶

By being silent, I realized a lot. All this time, I‚Äôve been feeding myself with
lies and unwillingness made up by myself. They don't say it for no reason that
silence is a language of the gods.

Eventually, I understood that I was just a **‚Äúsad machine‚Äù**‚Ä¶

Maybe I should change my personality again? That will do something! But no‚Ä¶ Why
should I keep running every time from my own lies? Indeed, it is the reality
that I crafted by myself for myself and I have to accept it no matter what - I
said to myself.

Maybe I‚Äôm feeling sad because I need more money? No, I already have enough to
eat, exist and do things that I love‚Ä¶ maybe I need more love? Idiot! You already
have the most merciful one who cares for you. _Maybe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just burning out?
Maybe, maybe‚Ä¶_

I understood that I was doing it wrong, I mean things that I didn‚Äôt enjoy and
love. I‚Äôm sure **Geno** and **UwU** would say the same if they had seen me now.
I had to do something, I have to change that...

After thinking for a while, I started finding the sources of my problem and made
lots of changes to my personality and did a git push in the end.

From now on, I refuse to share something on my blog, the blog will be left as an
archive of mine and will not get any updates anymore. I realized that I‚Äôm tired
from blogging and it was nothing but a waste of time. I would have crafted
something that would be more useful for people and share on open source, instead
of writing meaningless texts on social messengers. Blogging is a good tool for
people who seek improvements and keep track of the progress of your own, but it
can become a sort of mess or even worse, a bad instrument in the hands of
depression.

Maybe I will post something, but only if I make changes to my style and
intentions of writing something‚Ä¶ _maybe, maybe‚Ä¶_

Moreover, I‚Äôm leaving frontend development. Yes, you read it right! I‚Äôm tired of
crafting websites. I used to be keen on making websites and creating beautiful
graphics. However, the more I got deeper into system engineering, the more I
realized that I‚Äôve been forcing myself to do web things lately. Indeed, I might
create web or maintain my own website, but it all will be just for the sake of
my own things. Don‚Äôt expect from me a website anymore‚Ä¶ even if there will be,
it‚Äôll be just a mix of dark and white. I guess, it‚Äôs time to focus more on
things that I couldn‚Äôt finish, like **Xinux** maybe?)

I‚Äôll continue living as Yuri‚Ä¶ As this one will be my penultimate personality
I‚Äôll ever be and it has to serve me well for the next few years üòâ Simply, I‚Äôll
stop doing things that I dislike and focus more on what I‚Äôm currently enjoying.
I don‚Äôt know whether you should expect the next post or not, but I‚Äôll definitely
be online on Twitter‚Ä¶ so, see ya'll on Twitter. For the rest...

**Simply, Goodbye to Telegram and Frontend World!**
